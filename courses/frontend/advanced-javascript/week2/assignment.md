# Assignment

## 1. Codewars!

- [7 kyu Product Array (Array Series #5)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a905c2157c562994900009d/javascript)

## 2. Functions!

The warmup is a **little abstract**, it will get more concrete later on!

1. Display the text `Called after 2.5 seconds` on the page 2.5 seconds after the script is loaded.

2. Create a function that takes 2 parameters: `delay` and `stringToLog`. Calling this function should display the `stringToLog` on the page after `delay` seconds. Call the function you have created with some different arguments.

3. Create a button in html. When clicking this button, use the function you created in the previous task to display the text `Called after 5 seconds` on the page 5 seconds after the button is clicked.

4. Create two functions and assign them to two different variables. One function displays `Earth` on the page, the other displays `Saturn`. Now create a new third function that has one parameter: `planetLogFunction`. The only thing the third function should do is call the provided parameter function. Try calling the third function once with the `Earth` function and once with the `Saturn` function.

5. Create a button with the text "Log location". When this button is clicked, display the user's location (latitude, longitude) on the page using this [browser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API).

6. _Optional_ Now show that location on a map using e.g. the [Google maps api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)

7. Create a function called `runAfterDelay`. It has two parameters: `delay` and `callback`. When called the function should wait `delay` seconds and then call the provided callback function. Add an input in the HTML for the delay (in seconds) and a button; when the button is clicked, read the delay from the input and call `runAfterDelay` with that delay and a callback that displays something on the page.

8. Check if the user has double-clicked on the page. A double click is two clicks within 0.5 seconds. If a double click is detected, display the text "double click!" on the page.

9. Create a function called `jokeCreator` that has three parameters: `shouldTellFunnyJoke` (boolean), `logFunnyJoke` (function), and `logBadJoke` (function). If `shouldTellFunnyJoke` is `true` it should call `logFunnyJoke`, which displays a funny joke on the page. Otherwise it should call `logBadJoke`, which displays a bad joke on the page.

## 3. Function as a variable

Create functions that are used in these different ways:

- Create an array with 3 items. All items should be functions. Iterate through the array and call all the functions.
- Create a function as a const and try creating a function normally. Call both functions. You can read more about this in [What is the difference between a function expression vs declaration in JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1013385/what-is-the-difference-between-a-function-expression-vs-declaration-in-javascrip)
- Create an object that has a key whose value is a function. Try calling this function.

Yes I know that was a little tough, now on to the fun part 🎉

## 4. The fastest presser in this realm

Let's create a fun simple game :)

Here is the setup of the game: **Two users compete** about who can **press a key the most times** within a set time!

A user specifies how long time the game should be, and presses **"start game!"**. When the button is pressed it is about pressing either `l` or `s` on the keyboard. The user that has the highest number of keypresses after the time is up, wins 🎉

Here is a gif of how the site should work:

You can implement it exactly like you want to, but here is my recommended order:

1. **Create an input and a button in html**. When the button is clicked, get the value of the input. This value will be the amount of time the game should run.
2. **Set a timeout for the time specified by the user.** After that time has run out, display a message on the page (e.g. "Time's up!").
3. **Create an event listener** so you can call a function **when any key is pressed**. Now grab the actual key that was pressed. e.g. was it a `j` or an `i`. We are interested in `s` and `l`. Here Google is your friend!
4. **Keep a counter** for how many times `l` and `s` was pressed.
5. **Now put it all together!** After the timeout is done figure out which of the counters is largest. Give some kind of feedback to the users indicating who won.

## Optional Assignments

### 5. Extra features

1. **Start a new game** functionality. Create some functionality so that the users can restart a game.
2. Try and give the site some **styling so it looks nice** :)
3. **Custom feature**. Add something unique to the game! If you don't know how to implement it, just describe what it should do!
4. **Countdown to end of game** - _optional_. Have a countdown that simply counts down until the game is done.

Here are some general things to consider:

- What if a user starts pressing a key before the game is started, what should happen?
- What if the game is a draw? Are both winners? None winners? Maybe indicate to the user that is was a draw.
- What if no time was specified for the game?
- What if there were no key presses before the game ends?

### 6. Confetti

If you wanna give the game some confetti like in the gif, check out [this library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/confetti-js)

Use the library in your page by adding this line before you load your main.js:

```js
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/confetti-js@0.0.13/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```
